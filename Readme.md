# Stock Portfolio API

## Description

The lazy coder has been trying to build an API to fetch portfolios, get the total value of each portfolio, and delete
them. Some parts of the system work but it seems a bit buggy.

One suspicion is that the currency conversions are at fault but since the lazy developer has moved on to become a
gardener no one knows how to identify the problem and potentially fix it; that's where you come in.

## What To Do

Since you may not have time to do everything, please briefly explain what you chose to do and why. If you did not have
time to add something, please briefly describe in the PR notes what you would have liked to add, and how.

The code smells. It is filled with bad decisions, incomplete logic and half baked projects. Your job is, to the best of
your ability, refactor the code so that it meets the following criteria:

- An endpoint exists that returns the specified portfolio.
- An endpoint exists that returns the total value of all stocks in the portfolio in the specified currency.
- An endpoint exists to soft-delete portfolios (whatever that means, we don't know but we don't want to permanently lose
  the data).
- Has some unit tests (note: should not be exhaustive).
- Exchange rates should be fetched from CurrencyLayer, the key is included in the project. Please contact us in case it
  doesn't work and we will give you the new API key privately. Exchange rates do not need to be fetched for every call,
  and only need to be refreshed every 24 hours. Documentation is available at https://currencylayer.com/documentation.
  The account linked to the API key only has permission to get USD exchange rates, so you will need to convert from the
  base currency to USD and then from USD to the target currency.

_NOTE: The project StockService is impeccable and is off limits, you cannot change it whatsoever.

In addition to the above, we also want you to refactor some of the codebase using best practices. We have no idea what
all this means, some consultant just told us. Feel free to use any 3rd party libraries to help you with the task, given
they are OSS.

## Database

The project uses portable version of MongoDB as persistence by default. You are of course free to use another DB but if
you do, you will have to explain why, as with any decision made in the code base during a technical interview.

## When Finished

**Please send the code test to us by creating a pull request to the main branch.**
